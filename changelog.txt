Resolved an issue that would place sorted furniture a great distance from the home's entrance when the "Organize Furniture" option was disabled.

2019-12-22	Version 11
Revised the completion summary report to instead list furniture categories, if any, for which there was insufficient room to store those types of items based on your storage house category assignments.
The last sort's completion summary report will be shown side-by-side with the wizard's House Selection and Category Assignment screens to allow you to more easily adjust your houses/category assignments to address insufficient storage capacity, if necessary.

2019-12-24	Version 12
